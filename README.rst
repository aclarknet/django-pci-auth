django-pci-auth
===============

**Django 1.4+ only**

This library integrates the current Django "best of" PCI auth libraries into a single application, then fills in the gaps. Filling gaps may involve making additional decisions for you, as suggested by Django Documentation e.g.:

- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/auth/#using-bcrypt-with-django
- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/auth/#increasing-the-work-factor
- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/http/sessions/#session-cookie-age

Or in some cases additional functionality may be provided by this library e.g.:

- Database models to persist event data e.g. lockouts

Features
--------

- Stronger password hashing that allows for selection of hashing algorithm scrypt, bcrypt, PBKDF2, etc. via settings.py. [1]
- Checking for strong passwords with a default length setting overrideable in settings.py. [2]
- Integrate strong passwords into Django Admin.
- Lock out account for n minutes after x failed log-in attempts. [3]
- Set inactivity timeouts.

**XXX Below not done**

- Provide JavaScript to check for strong passwords inline.

  - Javascript code should check the Django settings via AJAX re: password length min/max, etc.

- Generate event/email when lock-out occurs.
- Set flags disallowing certain accounts to be locked out.

  - Persist beyond restart

- Log every log-on and explicit log-out (not necessary to log timed out log-ins).

  - Persist beyond restart

- Track last four passwords and do not allow re-use.

  - Persist beyond restart

- Force password reset after X amount of time.

  - Persist beyond restart

Installation
------------

Before you use this library in your applications you may wish to demo its functionality. To do so, follow these steps::

    $ virtualenv .
    $ bin/pip install django-pci-auth
    $ bin/django-admin.py syncdb --settings=django_pci_auth.settings
    $ bin/django-admin.py runserver --settings=django_pci_auth.settings

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/


Models
------
Here are the models that are currently in this project.

UserProfile
~~~~~~~~~~~
Profile model that stores two fields that are required 
(nolockout, and password_last_changed). If you already have a Profile model
you will need to add these fields to it.

Fields:
    - user (ForeignKey to User)
    - nolockout (Boolean)
    - password_last_changed (datetime)

AccessLog
~~~~~~~~~
A permeant log that tracks all of the access attempts.

Fields:
    - user_agent (CharField 255)
    - ip_address (IpAddress)
    - user (ForeignKey User)
    - trusted (Boolean)
    - http_accept (CharField 255 max)
    - path_info (CharField 255 max)
    - attempt_time (datetime)
    - logout_time (datetime)

PasswordLog
~~~~~~~~~~~
Keeps track of the recently used passwords for a user, so that
they aren't allowed to reuse the same ones over and over again.

Fields:
    - user (ForeignKey to User)
    - password (CharField 128 max)
    - create_date (datetime)


Background
----------

PCI is complex. Here is a bit of background on the subject. Inasmuch as it's possible to summarize here.

Levels
~~~~~~

**XXX Do we need to worry about levels?**

- PCI Compliance Level 1 - Merchants processing over 6 million Visa transactions annually (all channels) or Global merchants identified as Level 1 by any Visa region
- PCI Compliance Level 2 - Merchants processing 1 million to 6 million Visa transactions annually (all channels)
- PCI Compliance Level 3 - Merchants processing 20,000 to 1 million Visa e-commerce transactions annually
- PCI Compliance Level 4 - Merchants processing less than 20,000 Visa e-commerce transactions annually and all other merchants processing up to 1 million Visa transactions annually

Stronger password hashing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a built-in feature in Django 1.4+. Documented here for convenience::

    PASSWORD_HASHERS = (
        # From https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/auth/:
        # "[redacted] This means that Django will use the first hash in the list
        # to store all passwords, but will support checking passwords stored with
        # the rest of the hashes in the list. If you remove a hash from the list
        # it will no longer be supported.
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2SHA1PasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.BCryptPasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.SHA1PasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.MD5PasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.CryptPasswordHasher',
    )

Password Reuse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How many old passwords will you store? This will prevent users from using the
same password over again. It will keep the newest ones around. As they change
their password, the older ones will be removed.

    OLD_PASSWORD_STORAGE_NUM = 4

Issues
~~~~~~

Django-axes has been included here as a git submodule. But due to a bug in setuptools, this only works during installation (i.e. not during "python setup.py develop". See: https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/issue/177/setuppy-develop-doesnt-support-package_dir). To workaround the issue, try something like::

    from django.core import management

    import sys  # Hack-a-round setuptools 'python setup.py develop' bug
    sys.path.append('')

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        management.execute_from_command_line()
